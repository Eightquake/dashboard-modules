# dashboard-examples
A repo for all of my details and plugins that I have made and use for my dashboard. These are my personal ones and they might need some tweaking to make them into yours, like the latitude and longitude of weatherGothenburg.json.

This repo is suppposed to be cloned into the modules folder of [my other repo](https://github.com/Eightquake/dashboard), that is the main dashboard project. Of course, you could create your own plugins and details if that's what you want!
